# Movie Reader

A one-stop site to view movie information, reviews, and recommendations

## User Story

```
As a moviegoer, I want a one-stop site to see movie info and reviews

GIVEN a landing page where I can search for a film 
WHEN I type a movie into the search box
THEN I am directed to a page that lists the movie specs and reviews for the film
WHEN I reach the landing page
THEN I am shown recommendations for trending films
WHEN I search for a film
THEN That film is put in a sidebar of my recent searches
WHEN I am on a mobile screen
THEN I am provided with a shortened description of the film
WHEN I toggle dark mode on
THEN my preference is stored locally
```

## IDEAS

```
Recent searches
    - Autocomplete capability that accesses locally stored searches and recalls them as the user is typing
    - Search box drops down to show recent searches
```
